Transpose a matrix

Pass a matrix in and get a transposed matrix out

``````
const testMatrixSquare = [
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
];

transposeMatrix(testMatrixSquare)';
